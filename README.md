# SFU CMPT 340 Project Template -- Replace with project title
This repository is a template for your CMPT 340 course project.
Replace the title with your project title, and **add a snappy acronym that people remember (mnemonic)**.

Add a 1-2 line summary of your project here.

## 1. Example demo

A minimal example to showcase your work

```python
from amazing import amazingexample
imgs = amazingexample.demo()
for img in imgs:
    view(img)
```

### What to find where

Explain briefly what files are found where

```bash
repository
├── src                          ## source code of the package itself
├── scripts                      ## scripts, if needed
├── docs                         ## If needed, documentation   
├── README.md                    ## You are here
├── requirements.yml             ## If you use conda
```

## 2. Installation

## SAM setup 

The code requires python>=3.8, as well as pytorch>=1.7 and torchvision>=0.8
Python: 
PyTorch on Windows only supports Python 3.8-3.11, not sure about Macs
versions can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/


Pytorch and Torchvision: 
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#windows-installation
To ensure that PyTorch was installed correctly, we can verify the installation by running sample PyTorch code. Here we will construct a randomly initialized tensor.

```import torch
x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
```


The output should be something similar to:
```
tensor([[0.3380, 0.3845, 0.3217],
        [0.8337, 0.9050, 0.2650],
        [0.2979, 0.7141, 0.9069],
        [0.1449, 0.1132, 0.1375],
        [0.4675, 0.3947, 0.1426]])
```

SAM:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

Need to have downloaded: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
and then have the file in the same directory as the code 


Dependencies:
```
pip install opencv-python matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pydicom
```

```bash
mkdir tmp && cd tmp
wget https://yourstorageisourbusiness.com/dataset.zip
unzip dataset.zip
conda activate amazing
python evaluate.py --epochs=10 --data=/in/put/dir
```

## 4. Guidance

- Use [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
    - Do NOT use history re-editing (rebase)
    - Commit messages should be informative:
        - No: 'this should fix it', 'bump' commit messages
        - Yes: 'Resolve invalid API call in updating X'
    - Do NOT include IDE folders (.idea), or hidden files. Update your .gitignore where needed.
    - Do NOT use the repository to upload data
- Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a similarly powerful IDE
- Use [Copilot for free](https://dev.to/twizelissa/how-to-enable-github-copilot-for-free-as-student-4kal)
- Sign up for [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/)
